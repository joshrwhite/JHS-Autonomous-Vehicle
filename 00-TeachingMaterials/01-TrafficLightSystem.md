# Traffic Light System Assignment

Instead of buying a traffic light system for machine learning development, we will be strengthening our programming skills by creating our own Traffic Light System.

## Street Map

(Fill with image)

## Schematic

Create the schematic for a three-way intersection. We will be using three-way intersections only due to the I/O limits of our ROBOPro Interfaces.

With your team (either Red or Black), create a schematic for your three-way intersection. How many lights do you need? What inputs/sensors would you like? Make it as detailed as possible.

To complete: turn in a drawing (hand-drawn or using a free online program like [Circuit Diagram](https://www.circuit-diagram.org/)). Only one circuit is needed per team, but must include all aspects necessary for the traffic system design.

## Pseudocode

With your team, create a rough flowchart (pseudocode) for your three-way intersection. While this is a rough flowchart, you should still have all inputs and outputs accounted for.

To complete: turn in a drawing (hand-drawn or through a shape editor like Microsoft Visio/Word/PowerPoint). Only one drawing is needed per team, but must include all aspects necessary for the traffic system design.

## Flow Chart Program

With your team, create a finished flowchart, using ROBOPro, for your three-way intersection. All inputs and outputs should use ROBO Interface nomenclature and should be assigned to an appropriate input/output pin.

To complete: turn in the ROBOPro program. Only one drawing is needed per team, but must include all aspects necessary for the traffic system design.
