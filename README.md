# JHS-Autonomous-Vehicle
A repository for the JHS Autonomous Vehicle Team

## Objective
Our mission is to participate in the Autonomous Vehicle Challenge by Rose-Hulman. We will fulfill this goal through participation along the pathway laid out below so that we can develop auxiliary aspects of the autonomous vehicle system. We believe that a multidisciplinary approach is the only way to create a cohesive infrastructure for an autonomous future.

## Pathway
* Develop an autonomous vehicle from a Remote Control Car
* Scale the autonomous system to a 6-12V electric kids vehicle
* Build a fleet of electric vehicles for intraschool delivery system
* Create a mobile application for teacher supply delivery
